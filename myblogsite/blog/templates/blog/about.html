<h1>About This Site</h1>
<p> Django-Basic-BlogSite<br>
    This project has little to no styling and also contains only basic features necessary for a blog site.<br>
    This blog site doesn't have the author registration feature. For the time being, authors should be added from the admin panel itself.<br>
    I have used medium-style-editor in this project.<br>
