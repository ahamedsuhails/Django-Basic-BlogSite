# Django-Basic-BlogSite

This is my first major(for me) project.
This project has little to no styling and also contains only basic features necessary for a blog site.
So much work has to be done to make this project presentable atleast.
This blog site doesn't have the author registration feature. For the time being, authors should be added from the admin panel.
